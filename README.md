Sokoban (Push Box)
=======
This is an implementation of the popular game Sokoban (or Push Box). The rules are so simple! The player 
pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. Also:

  - A box cannot be pulled.
  - The player cannot walk through boxes or walls.
  - Only one box can be pushed at a time.
  - The puzzle is solved when all boxes are located at storage locations.

You can make your choice among ten levels. The higher the level, the more difficullt it gets!

Good luck!
